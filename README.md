# Company Classification using NLP Approaches

## Overview

This research paper is part of a collaboration between researchers from the [Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) at the
Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje and [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/).

## Features

Company classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to categorize businesses based on their textual descriptions. The purpose of the research paper is to employ various NLP approaches to tackle this problem, each with its own strengths and limitations.

## Installation

The code is available as Colab notebooks. The easiest way to use the notebooks is to upload them to and run them in [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory). The notebooks contain imports of the necessary Python libraries. There are no dependencies and no additional modules or libraries need to be installed.

## Known Limitations

We suggest to use GPU runtime when running the notebooks for more efficient compiling.
