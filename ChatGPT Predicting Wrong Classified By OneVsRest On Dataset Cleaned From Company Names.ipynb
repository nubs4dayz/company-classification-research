this approach, the WRDS dataset was used but the names of the companies from the descriptions were removed. Additionally, the descriptions that only contained the name of the company, were also removed (This is the reason for the smaller number of entries in this dataset compared to the WRDS dataset). We first labeled the indices for the different sectors and then partitioned them into training and testing sets (80-20 split). Prior to training the model, we preprocessed the company descriptions to remove any irrelevant information. We used the sentence transformer, specifically the 'all-mpnet-base-v2' model, to embed the preprocessed training and testing sets. These embedded sets were then fed into the OneVsRestClassifier to be trained.\n","The OneVsRestClassifier employed the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model as an estimator with the default radial basis function (rbf) kernel and deafult number of iterations.\n","\n","To further evaluate the performance of ChatGPT and our model in classifying company descriptions, we examined the descriptions that our model had incorrectly predicted. The removed company names from these descriptions played a significant role in eliminating potential bias resulting from ChatGPT's prior knowledge about these companies.\n","\n","ChatGPT also had difficulty in classifying these descriptions, suggesting that they pose a challenge for natural language processing models in general.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"R6YTizCA_XbC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Importing and preprocessing the dataset cleaned from company names"],"metadata":{"id":"uCcbWAUv_Xvs"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"acVhxR-9WHWS","outputId":"7ac477f0-ffd7-45d2-ea6f-0f0962f010a8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679336626134,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3162,"user":{"displayName":"branko kockica","userId":"11416956323742203166"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":389},"id":"oKkIju5Swq4J","outputId":"6d0c10a5-e1d6-4595-923d-20579026d083","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679336627408,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1278,"user":{"displayName":"branko kockica","userId":"11416956323742203166"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Unnamed: 0                   conm    gind  gsector     naics  \\\n","0           3  A.A.
